# Forge

Forge is a terraform bash script made to simplify my personal development environment.
All tools and packages you have listed here is the most basic for my daily use.
Another version of this same script if private where I added some extra packages that maybe not all engineers would use on their daily basis. Feel free to use it to build your own recepi or maybe extend the current one with extra packages.

## Use

Your machine maybe not recognize forge.sh as executable. The way to fix that is giving permission by typing the follow command inside the script directory:

    chmod +x forge.sh

The script can be executed by as follow on terminal:

    ./forge.sh

***Important***: There is no necessity to execute this script using sudo mode. The script will ask your permission when required.
